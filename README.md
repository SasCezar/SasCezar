# 👋 Hi, I'm Cezar Sas

I’m a PhD researcher in **AI for Software Engineering**, with a focus on applied **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and intelligent systems for analyzing code and technical content.

🧠 My research combined **language models** and **graph neural networks** for tasks such as software classification, semantic parsing, and multilingual information extraction.

🚀 I’m currently deepening my applied skills in **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **agent-based LLM systems**, and expanding into **production-oriented ML system design**. I'm building modular, reproducible pipelines using tools like **ZenML**, **Docker**, and **LangGraph** — turning prior knowledge into practical, system-oriented design.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python • PyTorch • Hugging Face • LangChain • LangGraph • Qdrant • MongoDB • Docker • ZenML

📂 Featured Projects:
- **AutoFL** – Semantic annotation of software files and packages
- **ScientificPapersRAG** – RAG pipeline for querying research papers with semantic search

I’m open to collaboration and roles in **AI/ML, applied NLP**, and **LLM-powered systems** — especially where research and engineering come together.
